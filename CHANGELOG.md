# Change Log

All notable changes to the Team X-Ray extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-17

### ✨ Features
- Status bar item now opens a quick-pick menu with common actions (Show Team Overview, Analyze Repository, Find Expert for File, Set History Window, Set GitHub Token, Set BYOK API Key, Open Settings) instead of running a single command.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Added diagnostic logging for AI response parse failures: the Team X-Ray output channel now captures the raw response and extracted JSON candidate when parsing fails, making intermittent "AI response could not be fully parsed" errors debuggable.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-17

### ✨ Features
- Added `teamxray.historyWindowDays` (default `90`) and `Team X-Ray: Set History Window` presets/custom input to scope git analysis to a recent window while keeping a fallback to full history when the window yields no commits.
- Added an immediate **Analyze Now** action after setting the history window, so users can run analysis directly from the confirmation prompt.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed Copilot SDK session configuration so BYOK model overrides are only applied when a BYOK provider is active, and added a clear error when `teamxray.byokModel` is missing for BYOK sessions.
- Added Copilot SDK timeout recovery for `session.idle` waits, including session abort + partial/delayed assistant response recovery before falling back.
- Hardened date handling for AI responses and rendering to avoid `Invalid time value` failures from malformed date fields.
- Hardened AI JSON extraction to recover valid balanced JSON payloads from noisy/mixed assistant responses instead of dropping to git-only analysis.
- Improved Copilot SDK failure logging for team and file analysis paths to surface useful error messages.

### 📖 Documentation
- Updated README and provider docs to reflect required BYOK model configuration and current fallback behavior.
- Corrected architecture docs to match the actual provider flow and tool behavior.

### 🔧 Infrastructure
- Migrated MCP config location from `.vscode/mcp.json` to `.mcp.json`.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-16

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed reports showing empty "Key Insights" and generic recommendations by wiring `generateAnalysisSummary()` and `generateRecommendations()` to the actual analysis data (`managementInsights`, `teamHealthMetrics`, and key insights), and added a fallback in the Copilot SDK path so the Key Insights section no longer vanishes when the insights array is empty. (#38)

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-10

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed bot/agent detection in the Copilot SDK analysis path so contributors from that flow are consistently tagged with `isBot`.
- Improved cross-repository report reliability by hardening git worker timeouts and adding a commit-history fallback when contributor queries time out.

### 📖 Documentation
- Clarified current positioning around Copilot SDK, GitHub Models fallback, and reduced local git fallback.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### 🚀 Major: Copilot SDK Integration
- **New AI engine**: Replaced MCP server architecture with GitHub Copilot SDK (`@github/copilot-sdk`). No more Docker containers or separate processes — the SDK runs directly inside the extension.
- **Smart fallback chain**: Copilot SDK → BYOK (bring your own key) → GitHub Models API → local-only analysis. If one tier is unavailable, the next kicks in automatically.
- **Custom tools via `defineTool` + Zod**: Five purpose-built tools the SDK agent uses to analyze repositories (file analysis, contributor stats, commit patterns, etc.)
- **Webpack ESM bundling**: Solved `@github/copilot-sdk` being ESM-only with `/* webpackIgnore: true */` on dynamic imports.

### 🤖 Agent & Bot Detection
- **`detectBot(name, email)` helper**: Identifies bot and agent contributors (Dependabot, Copilot, Renovate, etc.) from commit metadata.
- **Visual distinction**: Bot contributors get gray expertise bars and a 🤖 badge instead of the standard color scheme.
- **Why it matters**: As AI agents commit more code, you need to know which expertise is human and which is automated.

### 🎨 Dark X-Ray Redesign
- **Exported reports**: Complete visual overhaul — `#0a0a0f` background, cyan (`#06b6d4`) accent, CSS scan-line patterns, SVG bar charts. Looks like something out of a cybersecurity dashboard.
- **VS Code webview**: Matching dark theme for the in-editor view, consistent with exported reports.

### 📖 Documentation
- **README rewritten**: Added Copilot SDK architecture section, ASCII flow diagram, fallback chain table.
- **Architecture diagram**: Hand-drawn image replacing the old ASCII version.
- **SECURITY.md**: Added vulnerability reporting process.
- **FUNDING.yml**: Added GitHub Sponsors.

### 🔧 Infrastructure
- **Dropped Node 18**: CI now runs on Node 20+ only (`@vscode/vsce` requires it).
- **Security audit**: Changed from `--audit-level high` to `--omit=dev --audit-level critical` — dev-only vulns with no upstream fix were blocking CI for no reason.
- **CI PR comment fix**: `job.status` → `JOB_STATUS` env var.

### 📦 Dependencies
- Bumped rollup 4.53.3 → 4.59.0
- Bumped minimatch 3.1.2 → 3.1.5
- Bumped axios 1.12.0 → 1.13.5
- Bumped webpack 5.99.9 → 5.105.0
- Bumped fastify 5.6.2 → 5.7.4

## [1.0.5] - 2025-11-24

### ✨ UI Improvements
- **Redesigned HTML Reports**: Modern, professional report design with refined color palette
- **Expert Cards**: Clean layout with hover effects, pill-shaped role badges, and tag-style specializations
- **Management Insights**: Color-coded cards with top borders (Red/Risk, Green/Opportunity)
- **AI Section**: Distinct dark theme for strategic insights
- **Typography**: Updated to Inter font stack for better readability

### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **Evalite Integration**: Added eval-driven development framework for AI output testing
- **Custom Scorers**: Expert identification and collaboration pattern detection with 90%+ accuracy
- **GitHub Models Support**: Configured evalite to use GitHub Models API instead of OpenAI

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplicate function definitions in validation.ts causing compilation errors
- Resolved TypeScript/ESLint conflicts in evaluation files
